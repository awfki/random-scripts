These are various scripts that were hanging out in my ~/bin directory. As I'm trying to figure out git I thought I'd use them as guinea pigs.

getcfg - An expect script that logs into an ASA. As I've recently done this in Python with pexpect I'll change it to that.

ifcfg - Used just to flip the parameters passed into an alias.

ipcalc - Someone elses script for doing IP subnet calc on the CLI.

mac - Translates a MAC address into various formats

show - Emulates Cisco IOS "show" commands as I was tired of typing "show ip route" on my PC and getting an error.
