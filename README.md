These are various scripts that were hanging out in my ~/bin directory. As I'm trying to figure out git I thought I'd use them as guinea pigs.

2nd_Instance - is a reminder more than anything, of how to open a second instance of an app I use at work.

BingWallpaper.py - Found script for downloading Bing Wallpaper

Daily_Links_Sync - used with cron to sync the Daily Links Chrome extension between work and home

auto-wifi-off - something I found online and haven't done anything with

bouncewifi.py - Bounce wifi interface because it won't connect when it comes out of sleep

calsync - rsyncs my Calibre folder to my NAS

calupdate - Downloads and opens the latest Calibre.dmg

checkfiles - Dunno what this was. Kept for reference but never referred to.

com.dnoonan.wifiwatch.plist - plist for adding wifiwatch to lauchd so it will run every minute and can present a GUI dialog

commafy - Adds commas to a number. I think I found this online.

getcfg - An Python/pexpect script that logs into an ASA.

ifcfg - Used just to flip the parameters passed into an alias.

int - prints IP, netmask and MAC address for all interfaces in a nice table

int.awk - and awk version of int.  I should probably delete it.

ipcalc - Found script for doing IP subnet calc on the CLI.

mac - Flips a MAC address between Cisco and PC format

show - Emulates Cisco IOS "show" commands as I was tired of typing "show ip route" on my PC and getting an error.

type7 - found online, decrypts a Cisco type 7 password

whilefile - bash example file

wifiwatch - bash script that works with the plist above to tell me when my SSID changes.

wifiwatch.scpt - applescript version of the above that wouldn't work from cron.
